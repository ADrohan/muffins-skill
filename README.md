Muffin baking

## About
This is a kitchen helper skill to assist in baking muffins. 

A user may ask for a recipe's ingredients or the method to make muffins.

A user can also check ingredients are stocked in their kitchen. Although the response is a random number, Mycroft will assess from the number returned if you need supplies or not. If you are short Mycroft will even offer to place an order for you.

## Examples
* "What is a good recipe for muffins?"
* "Can I please have the method?"
* "Please give me a recipe for raspberry muffins"
* "Have I enough ingredients to make blueberry muffins?"
* "Can I have the method for blueberry muffins please?"
